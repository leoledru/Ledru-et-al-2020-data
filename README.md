# Ledru et al 2020: data
Data from the paper "Spatial structure of natural boxwood and box tree moth can promote coexistence despite long-distance dispersal"  

This work was initially "only" a Master's internship, without really thinking that it could become a publication. Thus, the data was not immediately organized with the necessary rigor. When the work finally reached the form of a complete and serious publication, I had to format the data in order to be able to share it. I hope you will find here a clear enough organization to understand the data, but I ask you to keep this in mind if you find the data a bit of a mess.
